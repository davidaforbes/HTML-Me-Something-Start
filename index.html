         <p> The system's primary source of light, a massive pillar of radiant energy that extends seemingly infinitely into the void. From its base the Shining Sea emerges, golden plasma that flows in and out of the gravity wells of the Spheres, and allows easy travel between them.  </p>

         <p> An inhospitable world of artifice and scorching sands. Water is scarce and temperatures dangerously high outside of the Stalac Cities, 
         <br> which lie beneath the desert's surface in the hollow core. At the sphere's center is the Carnelian, a small red star used by the dwarves 
         <br> to power their forges, the only place where the unbreakable metal Orichalc can be created. </p>

         <p> A disc shaped world, tidally locked with the Pillar's light so that one side experiences endless day and the other endless night. 
         <br>The Dayside is home to the utopian city Almyygdra, a world tree the elves used to reach the stars. 
         <br>However, its cultivation stopped the rotation of the planet, causing an apocalyptic ice age on the opposite side of the disc, 
         <br>where the Nadyr have adapted to eternal darkness and frigid temperatures. After a century long war when the elven civilizations first met, a fragile peace has formed. </p>
