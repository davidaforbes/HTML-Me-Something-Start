      <h1> The Pillar</h1>
         <p class="crt"> The system's primary source of light, a massive pillar of radiant energy that extends seemingly infinitely into the void. From its base the Shining Sea emerges, golden plasma that flows in and out of the gravity wells of the Spheres, and allows easy travel between them.  </p>
      <h1>Forge</h1>
         <p> An inhospitable world of artifice and scorching sands. Water is scarce and temperatures dangerously high outside of the Stalac Cities, 
         <br> which lie beneath the desert's surface in the hollow core. At the sphere's center is the Carnelian, a small red star used by the dwarves 
         <br> to power their forges, the only place where the unbreakable metal Orichalc can be created. </p>
            <h2> Factions </h2>
            <h3>Dwarves</h3>
            <h3>Dralac (Lizardfolk)</h3>
            <h3>Thermacians (Wickermen, Amblers)</h3>
      <h1>Lusan Alfa</h1>
         <p> A disc shaped world, tidally locked with the Pillar's light so that one side experiences endless day and the other endless night. 
         <br>The Dayside is home to the utopian city Almyygdra, a world tree the elves used to reach the stars. 
         <br>However, its cultivation stopped the rotation of the planet, causing an apocolyptic ice age on the opposite side of the disc, 
         <br>where the Nadyr have adapted to eternal darkness and frigid temperatures. After a century long war when the elven civilizations first met, a fragile peace has formed. </p>

               <h3>The Gossamer Court</h3>
      <h1>The World Ark</h1>
            <p>The primary flagship of the Federation of World Ark Colleges, a society dedicated 
            <br>to the pursuit of knowledge, exploration of the unknown, and the defense of biodiversity and sentience in all of creation. 
            <br>Founded by the Ark Mages, some of the most powerful wizards in history, who created the World Ark to escape the dying Oss'Madi</p>
               <h2>Factions</h2>
               <h3>The Federation of World Ark Colleges</h3>
               <h3>The Klabatter Entities</h3>
      <h1>The Clockface</h1>
            <p> A temporal rift of mysterious origins. Each cycle the destination changes to a different parallel universe.
            <br> Almost all documented destinations have been subject to an apocalyptic event. </p>
      <h1>The Corpse Belt</h1>
         <p> A torus shaped loose collection of macrobiological matter, thought to be remains of a space leviathan still in the process of a centuries long decomposition process.
         <br> Inhabited by outlaws and those that value their privacy. </p>
            <h2> Factions</h2>
            <h3>The Scav Clans</h3>
      <h1 class="crt">Oss'Madi</h1>
         <p>The cradle of humanity, rendered a necromantic wasteland by powerful Sorceror long ago. An undead ecosystem has developed and stabilized, 
         <br>leading to a world where traditionally "living" beings are extremely rare. 
         <br>The remnants of the Necromancer's war machine still remain, drawing looters and researchers alike. </p>
            <h2>Factions</h2>
            <h3>The Liberati (Corps Dechaineliers)</h3>
            <h3>The Hounds of Dalo'Bask</h3>
            <h3>The Lunacy Cults</h3>
      <h1>Nygothlxca</h1>
      <p>The Unblinking Eye, a distant, oceanic world, speculated to be the eye of the Leviathan. 
         <br>This is the home of the Cthonoids, who guard their secrets closely in their sunken enclaves and mobile Cnidarian Citadels. 
         <br>The apocalyptic cults that once dominated the sphere have given way to a new religious majority that seek to enrich the universe by spreading knowledge and good health...
         <br>so that creation may be more delicious when their infinite headed deity the Voidmind returns.</P>
